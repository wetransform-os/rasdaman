This directory holds SECORE tests. For full information see ../test_wcps/README
This README contains only the additional information specific to SECORE tests.


----------------
= Adding tests =
----------------

To add new tests to the test suite, simply add new URIs to the queries/
directory. Please adhere to the naming convention, continuing from the last
number:

    KVP URI : number-%TYPE%_meaningful_name.kvp
RESTful URI : number-%TYPE%_meaningful_name.rest

where %TYPE% can either be (meanings are self-explanatory):

  * single_crs
  * compound_crs
  * parametrized_crs
  * crs_(in)?equality

Tests which verify the same functionality shall have the same ``number'', and 
will differ in their extension.

The test URIs are only partial and meant to be *appended* to the configured
SECORE URL, so in:

    http://<secore_host>:<secore_port>/def{%s}

{%s} shall be the URI part inside each queries/* file.

For better readability, the URI can be split in multiple lines: new lines and 
white spaces are trimmed out during the tests.


-----------
= Remarks =
-----------

In case of compound CRSs and equality tests, use the keyword ``%SECORE_URL%'' 
instead of hard-wiring endpoints, e.g.:

  WRONG: /crs-compound?1=http://localhost:8080/def/crs/EPSG/0/4327&2=http://localhost:8080/def/crs?authority=EPSG&version=0&code=5715
CORRECT: /crs-compound?1=%SECORE_URL%/crs/EPSG/0/4327&2=%SECORE_URL%/crs?authority=EPSG&version=0&code=5715

[pcampalani 19-nov-2013] 09-single_crs_illegal_optional_parameter.rest: difference in ows:ExceptionText but will be fixed with #556.
