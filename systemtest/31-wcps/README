Environment variables used later on in this document:
RMANBASE       # base path to the checked out rasdaman source code.

IMPORTANT: This README should be found in
$RMANBASE/systemtest/test_petascope/test_wcps directory.

This directory holds WCPS tests and it has the following structure.
.
├── oracle     # expected result outputs
├── output     # result output from running test queris
├── queries    # test queries in WCPS abstract syntax
├── testdata   # contains data used by tests
├── README     # this file
└── test.sh    # the test script

Variables like Tomcat port, host, etc. may need to be adapted in util/test.cfg
before running the tests. The testdata folder contains the testing images and
data. All the queries are contained in the queries directory, to add a new test
please refer to the "Adding tests" section in this document.
The oracle folder contains oracles required for the test verification.
To generate a new oracle, just remove the existing oracle and run the tests.
The respective output from the test will be automatically copied to the
oracle dir. In case of XML documents, it is highly recommended to let the
systemtest add the oracle automatically since the body of the result is
modified by the engine to have more robust comparisons.
For more information please refer to the "Adding tests" section in this document.

To run the tests, execute:

  ./test.sh

Do not execute "sh test.sh" as the script is written for bash, and sh is often
linked to a restricted version of bash like dash, or similar.

The test.sh script works as follow:

It runs each query from the file with extension .test against the configured
WCPS endpoint, taking the filename as "testname". The output from each test is
written to the output directory as testname.out. If a script testname.check.sh
is found in the queries dir, it is executed (passing the path to the output
file and oracle file as parameters) and the test is passed if this script
returns 0. The testname.check.sh allows for custom test verificaton to be
inserted into the process. If testname.check.sh is not found, the output
is compared to oracle/testname.oracle by means of type conversion with GDAL,
ensuring that the comparison is portable and works on different platforms..
The script translates images to the GTiff format before doing byte comparison,
while it directly compares to the oracle if the output is ASCII Text.
test.sh outputs either a list of failed tests (returning non-zero exit code)
or the message all tests passed (returning 0 as its exit code).

Furthermore, if a testname.pre.sh script is found in the queries dir, it will
be run before executing the test. This can be used for setting up the test, by
importing special data for example. Similarly, if a testname.post.sh script is
found, it will be executed after the test is run.

The log is located in the log file in this directory.

= Adding tests =
----------------

This test suite only supports WCPS queries.

To add new tests to the test suite, simply add new WCPS queries to the queries
directory. Then run the test.sh script, which will automatically add the output
to the oracle dir, under name testname.oracle. Manually inspect and verify
whether the output is correct.
If custom verification is required (ex. it is an image that is not portable)
create the queries/testname.check.sh script for verification (in this script you
can use any tool for verification of the output, just be sure that it is available
on the system or output a message if it is not found since this script will be
executed on a variety of systems, not just your own machine.

Due to the nature of the test verification there is also a possibility of
adding a failing test. A similar procedure is used and an error message is used
as oracle.

If additional steps are required before/after running the tests, add
testname.pre.sh/testname.post.sh scripts to the queries dir.

Please adhere to the naming convention, continuing from the last number:

WCPS abstract: number-meaningful_name[.error].test
WCPS XML     : number-meaningful_name[.error].xml
pre script   : number-meaningful_name[.error].test.pre.sh
post script  : number-meaningful_name[.error].test.post.sh
check script : number-meaningful_name[.error].test.check.sh
oracle       : number-meaningful_name[.error].test.oracle

If the test is meant to raise an exception, add a further `.error' suffix
to the file name before its extension, for both query and oracle.
