$PROG 
Generate an array (at given file path) encoded in given format, sdom and values in each cell.

Usage: ./generate_data.sh <result_file_path> <format> <sdom> <cell_values>

The script runs a rasql expression of the form:
SELECT encode(MARRAY i IN <sdom> VALUES <cell_values>, "<format>")

Therefore the <cell_values> can include an iterator i as well.

The result file path is printed to stdout, which might be slightly different from the
provided path (an extension could be automatically appended). Non-zero exit code indicates
success as usual.

Example: ./generate_data.sh "/tmp/test_ones" "GTiff" "[0:10,0:10]" "i[0] + 0.5f"
EOF
}

if [ $# -ne 4 ]; then
    usage
    exit 1
