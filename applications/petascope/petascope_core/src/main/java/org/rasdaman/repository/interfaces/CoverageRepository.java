/**
 * Repository to store the Coverage object to database
 */

// NOTE: LOB object from Postgresql will throw exception without it is fetched in method annoted by @Transactional.

// Any data model object which is read in transaction and later is updated values in Petascope without an explicit save() to database
// will be actually updated internally by Hibernate by the auto commit mode.
// Hence, use this @Transactional annotation at this ***lowest level*** for SELECT queries when it is needed only which expects change temporarily in java objects.
// And annote the upper level methods with @Transactional for UPDATE, DELETE queries when these method are invoked explicitly
// (e.g: from WCS UpdateCoverage request, DeleteCoverage request)

// A typical example for SELECT query is: the CRS of axis when it is saved to petascopedb should be the template format 
// (e.g: $SECORE_URL$/crs/EPSG/0/4326 not http://localhost:8080/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326).
// As later, Petascope will replace the prefix $SECORE_URL$ by the value configured in petascope.properties (e.g: http://opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326).
// However, Hibernate shouldn't persist this change to petascopedb and the template CRS with should be intact.
